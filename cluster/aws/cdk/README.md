# CDK

This contains AWS infrastructure for the AWS implemention.

To deploy:

* install the CDK CLI
* `cdk deploy` in this directory

A CloudFormation stack will be created with the resources needed for running clusters. If deployed with defaults, the AWS implementation will automatically detect the CloudFormation stack and all of its resources.
